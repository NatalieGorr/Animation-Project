# Animation-Project

This is a minigmame created using java and processing.

The objective of the game is to pass the balloon(red circle) between as many clouds(white rectangles) as possible.
If the baloon passes through a cloud however, the game ends. The y position of the baloon is never changed and the x position is changed by tracking the x position of the mouse. Once the player starts the program the balloon starts moving. When the player hits a cloud the game will end and the user will have the option to click to play again or press 'q' to quit.
